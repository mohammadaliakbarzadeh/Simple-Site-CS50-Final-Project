# Simple-Site-CS50-Final-Project
This project is a minimalist website built with HTML and CSS, developed for my CS50 final project. It demonstrates a clean and responsive design, with a focus on well-structured code and mobile-friendly layouts. This site serves as one of my first portfolio projects, highlighting my foundation in web development.
